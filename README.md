# FBI-gun-project-DAND
IPython notebook. You can find installation instructions here. Why this Project? In this project, you'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process. You'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!
